# An Analysis of Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## The project analyzes a large qualitative and quantitative dataset composed of fundraising goals and pledges for various kickstarter campaigs 

### The purpose of the project is to help Louise uncover trends that will allow her to compare her kickstarter campaign to others in relation ot fundraiser goals and launch date outcomes

## The analysis uncovered trends from taking tabular data and formating it into pivot tables that were filtered to showcase trends in outcomes by launch dates in addition to discovering success vs failure patterns relative to campaign goals 

### Analysis of outcomes based on Launch datefor theater seem to favor summer months of May and June, where the outcomes were the most successful with goals being met. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals- The higher the funding goal the more likely the campaign would fail; in contrast, those campaigns whose goals were relatively cheaper had the highest percentage of success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1. The countsif function presented a challenge due to the number of categories and criteria to analyze when presenting data to showcase the goals outcomes. This was overcome by listing each criteria into the workbook, then reformating the results to include additional criteria and ranges for accuracy.

## Results
1. The data appears to demonstrate a positive correlation between lower goal amounts and higher percentage of campaign outcomes, in addition to providing Louise with the best timing to start a campaign. 
2. Some limitations of the data set include can arguably be based on geography. It would be interesting to see how the outcomes would change with a larger distribution of geographic locations to see if we could uncover more trends about the likelihood of successful vs failed campaigns based on demographics.
3. Even though the time frames of the data span at least 9 years, the larger the distribution the likely less variance in data which might make decision making to launch a campaign with a particular goal amount more certain
